# Health_Insurance_Fraud_Detector

# Project Description
Health insurance fraud is a significant challenge facing Medicare, a federal health insurance program. \
As the Fraud Detection and Prevention Unit, our mission is to assist Medicare in identifying and preventing potential fraudulent claims.

We have proposed two strategic approaches to address this issue:
- Identify fraudulent claims: By detecting individual fraudulent claims, we can uncover patterns that may indicate broader systemic issues.
- Identify false healthcare provider: By scrutinizing healthcare providers, we can expose those who engage in fraudulent practices.

Detecting a single fraudulent claim can often reveal larger, underlying patterns of fraud, \
helping us protect Medicare's integrity and ensure its resources are used appropriately.

# Benchmark
- Benchmark 1: Rely on domain experts to manually review claims, ~0.00%
- Benchmark 2: Claim Audits Team , random or target, vary 20%-40%

# Common Types of Healthcare Fraud
- Fraud Committed by Medical Providers

Double billing: Submitting multiple claims for the same service\
Phantom billing: Billing for a service visit or supplies the patient never received \
Unbundling: Submitting multiple bills for the same service \
Upcoding: Billing for a more expensive service than the patient actually received

- Fraud Committed by Patients and Other Individuals

Bogus marketing: Convincing people to provide their health insurance identification number and other personal information to bill for non-rendered services, steal their identity, or enroll them in a fake benefit plan\
Identity theft/identity swapping: Using another personâ€™s health insurance or allowing another person to use your insurance\
Impersonating a healthcare professional: Providing or billing for health services or equipment without a license

- Fraud Involving Prescriptions

Forgery: Creating or using forged prescriptions\
Diversion: Diverting legal prescriptions for illegal uses, such as selling your prescription medication\
Doctor shopping: Visiting multiple providers to get prescriptions for controlled substances or getting prescriptions from medical offices that engage in unethical practices
