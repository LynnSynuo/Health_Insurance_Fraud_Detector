# Project Description
Health insurance fraud is one of the biggest problem facing medicare
We work as a fraud team in Medicare, a federal health insurance program

We proposed two directions to address this problem:
Identify fraudulent claims 
Identify false healthcare provider

Discovering a single fraudulent claim could indicate a pattern or a systemic issue

# Case of Healthcare Fraud
“The majority of fraud cases are schemes perpetrated by highly sophisticated organizations, not hospitals or physicians who may make a billing error or two,” Stewart said. 
“For example, criminal organizations may buy health data on the dark web, pose as clinicians, and then submit fake health insurance claims using the data.”

Earlier this year, a Michigan doctor was sentenced to prison for defrauding health insurers out of $250 million by billing for unnecessary spinal injections as part of an opioid distribution scheme. Over a five-year period, the physician billed Medicare for these lucrative injections more than any other provider in the nation, giving opioid prescriptions to patients who would receive the medically needless shots.
